# warwick.io
My personal profile webpage. Just a bit of a display/showoff page for my side project and hussels, with a sprinkle of photos thrown in.

## Development

#### Code
Hand crafted HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Was looking to build this simple single page with using no frameworks or prebuilt styles, just for a bit of fun really.

* HTML: handcraft :nut_and_bolt:
* CSS: self styled component pattenered :sparkles:
* Javascript: my favourite flavour, Vanilla :icecream:
* Database: local .json files :floppy_disk:

#### Design
Won't deny I styled the design on the works of <a href="issacforman.com.au">issacforman.com.au</a> - I plan to get in touch as he's an Adelaidian also.

#### Hosting 
Hosted on github pages with a custom url

## Deploy

#### Git Commands to update master branch
```
git add . 
git commit -m "updates"
git push -u origin master
```
#### Push assets from /dist to gh-pages branch

* gh-pages - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages
npm package installs a command line utility, which published everything in dist folder to gh-pages branch

```
npm run deploy
```
